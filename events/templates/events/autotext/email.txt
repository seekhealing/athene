What's a Connection Practice meeting?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No
conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel
a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that
we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage
time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and
another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big
emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is
encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.
